 And we also have a manifest file. So the client will always fetch the manifest file and the manifest file will tell the client the client's browser which file will download and fetch from the CDM. That is a content distribution network. And these are, the videos are segregated into segments because in the last few five minutes, segment is sent to the server, encoded, trans coded, and this file seconds is then fetched by the client. So this is the basic flow of the real time service. Now comes the M and Cemary file. So this once we get the video segments in the storage, the video segment will be sent to a job, your explainer's job queue. Before that, the video segment is converted into audio drums. So this audio trunks is sent to the queue and the queue will send it to the M and model which we are using here as a whisper. We get into the inner workings of the whisper later. So it will convert the audio sign into transcriptions, And the MN model will convert these transcriptions into summaries and store it in the database. So every time a client will fetch a summary, the video will not be converted into transcription and summary and then set to the client. We are cashing the summary and will directly send the summary to the client. So that is how we are saving up on the MN course. And the drop queue is like MN model will take the required time over there to convert to audio file into transcription, the transcription is into ML model. So if a new chunk comes, we are storing it in a queue. So one by one, once the ML model is ready, then send the next one, then send the next one. So likewise, we are maintaining the state of the transcriptions as the summary and storing it in the cache. So that was basically the system architecture which we are using. Yes, we did. So basically this is the client.
