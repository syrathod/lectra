 belly. Even as we were in the belly of the earth and am one of the similarity known to his eye. Oh yes, so he heightened the hunger. There was no way to describe the pains that not having eaten for months brought us. And yet we were kept alive. Stomachs that were merely cauldrons of acid bubbling, foaming the acid coming up through holes in our pellores, always shooting spears of sliver thin pain into our chest. It was the pain of the terminal ulcer, terminal cancer, terminal paracis. It was passing kidney stones endlessly. It was unending pain. It was... And we passed through the cavern of rats. And we passed through the path of boiling steam. And we passed through the country of the blind. And we passed through the sloth of despond. And we passed through the veil of tears. And we came finally Hosanna to the ice caverns, a rise inless thousands of miles in which the ice had formed in blue and silver flashes where Nova has lived in the glass. The down dropping... still actites as thick and glorious as diamonds that had been made to run like jelly and then solidified in graceful eternities of smooth sharp perfection. We saw the stack of canned goods and we tried to run to them. We fell in the snow and we got up and went on and then he shoved us away and went at them and poured them and gummed them and not at them and he could not open them. Had not given us a tool to open the cans. Benny grabbed a three-court can of guava shells and began to batter it, batter it against the ice bag. The ice flew and shattered but the can was merely dented while we hurt the laughter of a fat lady high overhead and echoing down and down and down the tundra. Benny went completely mad and rage began throwing cans as we all scrambled about of the snow and ice trying to find a way to end it. helped us agony of frustration and there was no way. And then Benny's mouth began to drool and he flung himself on. And he flung himself on. And in that instant I felt terribly calm surrounded by madness surrounded by hunger surrounded by everything but death. I knew death was our only way out. And had kept us alive but there was a way to defeat him. Not a total defeat but at least peace. Peace I would settle for that. I had to do it quickly. Benny, oh god, Benny was eating gaurster's face. Gaurster on his side, thrashing snow. Benny wrapped around him with powerful monkey legs crushing gaursters waste. His hands locked around gaursters head like a nutcracker in his mouth ripping at the tender skin of gaurster. Garsher screamed with such jagged-edged violence that stalactites fell. They plunged down, softly erect in the receiving snow drifts, spears, hundreds of them, everywhere, protruding from the snow. Benny's head pulled back sharply as something gave all at once at a bleeding raw white dripping of flesh, hung from his teeth. Ellen's face black against the white snow, dominoes in chalk dust, nimb-dock with no expression but highs. All eyes. Garsher half-conscious. Benny now an animal. I knew Anne would let him play. Garsher would not die, but Benny would fill his stomach. I turned half to my right and drew a huge ice spear from the snow. All in an instant. I drove the great ice point ahead of me like a battering ram, braced against my right thigh. It struck Benny on the right side just under the ribcage and drove up with through his stomach and broke inside him. He pitched forward and laced. still. Gorrister land his back. I pulled another spear-free and straddled him still moving, driving the spear straight down through his throat. His eyes closed as the cold penetrated. Ellen must have realized what I had decided, even his fear gripped her. She ran at Nim-Dok with a short icicle as he screamed, and into his mouth, and the force of her rushed at the job. His head jerked sharply, as if it had been nailed to the snow crust behind him. All in an instant. That was an eternity beat of soundless anticipation. I could hear Amdrah in his breath. His toys had been taken from him. Three of them were dead, could not be revived. He could keep us alive by his strength and talent, but he was not God. He could not bring them back. Ellen looked at me. Her ebony features stark against the snow that surrounded us. There was and pleading in her manner the way she held herself ready. I knew we had only a heartbeat before M would stop us. It struck her and she folded toward me bleeding from the mouth. I could not read meaning into her expression. The pain had been too great, had contorted her face, but it might have been thank you. It's possible please. Some hundreds of years may have passed. I don't know. M has been having fun for some time, accelerating and retarding my time since. I will say the word now. No, no, no. No. It took me 10 months to say no, no, no. I don't know. I don't know. I think it has been some hundreds of years. Oh, he was furious. He wouldn't let me bury them. It didn't matter. There was no way to dig up the deck plates. He dried up the snow. He brought the night. He roared and sent locusts. Didn't do a thing. They stayed dead. I'd had him. He was furious. I have thought I'm hated me before. Oh, I was wrong. It was not even a shadow of the hatey now. Slavr from every printed circuit. He made certain I would suffer eternally and could not do myself in. He left my mind intact. I can dream. I can wonder. I can lament. I remember all four of them. I wish. Wow. Doesn't make any sense. I know I save them. I know I can't have forget killing them. Helen's face. It is easy sometimes. want to, it doesn't matter. M has altered me for his own piece of mind, I suppose. He doesn't want me to run at full speed into a computer bank and smash my skull, or hold my breath till I faint, or cut my throat on a rusted sheet of metal. There are reflective surfaces down here. I will describe myself as I see myself. I am a great soft, jelly thing, smoothly rounded with no mouth, with pulsing white holes filled by fog, where my eyes used to be. Rubbery appendages that were once by arms, bulks rounding down into legless humps of soft slippery matter. I leave a moist trail when I move. Blotches of diseased evil gray come and go on my surface, as though light is being beamed from within. Outwardly. Dumbly I shamble about a thing that could never have been known as human. A thing whose shape is so alien, a travesty that humanity becomes more obscene for the vague resemblance. Inwardly, alone, here, living under the land, under the sea, in the belly of Am whom we created, because our time was badly spent, and we must have known unconsciously that he could do it better. At least the four of them are safe at last. Am will be all the matter for that. It makes me a little happier, and yet Am has won simply. He has taken his revenge on me. I have to help. And I'm a scream.
