 side where the streaming stream is currently live. So this stream is done through the base on this server. So what always does is it encodes the video stream and then to the backend it is sent through the RTMB protocol. So this is that server, this is the RTMB server right. So on the encoded video files are stored and sent from this RTMB to the backend and after that it is again transported into bit rates like the bit store for different video quantities like 1, n, d, 7, 20. After that the video segments are created and they are stored in the manifest side, the manifest files. So client can see that sorry client So, the client requires these manifest files and the stream is view on this platform using the HLS protocol which is the HTTP live streaming protocol. So, we are seeing this view to HLS. So, the videos are segregated into segments. So, which file to play when that is stored in the manifest file and how should the client fetch that segment of the file where it is located that is where the manifest file is used. So, this is basically the stream.m3, you know it is the, we are using HLS protocol to send that from the server to the client. So, what is the cyber depth check? So, like it could be anything between 3 to 5 seconds. We are using 5 seconds just check. So, yeah. And the big red we are using is 1.2 mpms. I have 25 frames per second. So, it is less computation of the same thing but bandwidth required is high. So, of HLS protocol it is... to have various bandwriters. So that with Lord Bandwid also we can have a low quality video that the client can see. So this is the streaming part. Welcome to the ML part. And one more thing is remaining is that we have also integrated the chat using WebSocket. This was also in the environment from the app lab. They also need a chat server. So sides we will explain the ML model. Hello I am Sassayesh and I was responsible for the best side of this. So we have met the ML architect using lion's head and lion's head. So if you don't know lion's head is used for basic building and a lot of applications and land off it is used to multi-earned architect. This is in the form of multi-s. So, that is how graph is created in line graph. So, the line graph graph on our system looks something like this. Being the understanding each of these pages as we go, we type it into them step by step. So, first we start with transcription. We are using open-air, this graph for this task. So, this part is nothing but an case of model in this task for automatic speech record here. But why is this thing? I think it is being referred to survey by Guy Paul Stoyans himself. And he basically compared this with Google Microsoft and it's other competitors. So, what we found out was on the basis of all the data.
