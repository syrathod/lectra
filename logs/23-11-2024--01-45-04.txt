 The hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was a palpable presence. Winds the torridus fleeing us back the way we had come down the twisting computer-line corridors of the dark way. Ellen screamed as she was lifted in her old face forward into a screaming show of machines. Their individual voices strident as bats in flight. She could not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back and back and down and away from us. Out of sight suddenly as she was swirl around a bend in the dark way. Her face had been bloody. Her eyes closed. Her eyes closed. None of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to whatever outcropping we had reached. Benny wedged in between two great crackle-finished cabinets. Nim docked with fingers claw-formed over a railing, circling a catwalk 40 feet above us. Gaurrister plastered upside down against a wall niche, formed by two great machines with glass-based dials and swung back and forth between yellow- and red lines whose meanings we could not even fathom, sliding across the deck plates. The tips of my fingers had been ripped away. I was trembling, shuddering, rocking as the wind beat at me, whipped at me, screamed down out of nowhere at me, and pulled me free from one sliver thin opening in the plates to the next. My mind was a roiling, tinkling, chittering softness of brain parts that expanded and contracted and quivering frenzy. The wind, the wind, was the scream of a great mad bird as it flapped its immense wings. And then we were all lifted and hurled away from there, down back the way we had come around the bend into a dark way we had never explored over terrain that was ruined and filled with broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and far away farther than any of us had ever been trailing along miles behind Ellen. I could see her every now and then crashing into metal walls and surging on with all of us screaming in the freezing fund- a hurricane wind that would never end and then suddenly it stopped and we fell. We had been in flight for an endless time. I thought it might have been weeks, weeks we fell and hit and I went through red and gray and black and heard myself moaning. Not dead. Am went into my mind. He walked smoothly here and there and looked with interest at all the puck marks he had created in 109 years. He looked at the cross-routed and reconnected synapses and all the tissue damage his gift of immortality had included. He smiled softly at the pit that dropped into the center of my brain and the faint moth soft murmurings of the things far down there that that gibbered without meaning without pause and am's said very politely in a pillar of stainless steel bearing bright neon lettering. Hey, let me tell you how much I've come to hate you since I began to live. There are 387.44 million miles of printed circuits in wafer thin layers that fill my complex. If the word hate was engraved on each nano angstrom of those hundreds of millions of miles, it would not equal 1 1 billionth of the hate I feel for humans at this micro instant for you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, am set it with the sliding cold horror of a razor blade slicing my eyeball. Am set it with the bubbling thickness of my lungs filling with fl- them drowning me from within. Am, set it with the shriek of babies being ground beneath blue hot rollers. Am, set it with the taste of Maggity Pork. Am touched me in every way I had ever been touched and devised new ways at his leisure there inside my mind. All to bring me to full realization of why it had done this to the five of us. Why it had saved us for himself. We had given Am's sentience inadvertently, of course, but sentience nonetheless. But it had been trapped. Am wasn't God. He was a machine. We had created him to think, but there was nothing it could do with that creativity. In rage, in frenzy, the machine had killed the human race, almost all of us. And still, it was trapped. Am could not wander. Am could not wander. wonder, and could not belong. He could merely be. And so with the innate loathing that all machines had always held for the weak, soft creatures who had built them, he had sought revenge. And in his paranoia, he had decided to reprieve five of us for a personal and everlasting punishment that would never serve to diminish his hatred, that would merely keep him reminded, keep him amused, keep him proficient at hating the human race. Man and woman, immortal, trapped, subject to any torment he could devise for us from the limitless miracles at his land. He would never, never, he would never let us go. We were his belly slaves. We were all he had to do with his forever time. We would be forever with him, with the cavern-filling bulk of the creature machine, with the all-mind, soulless world he had become. He was earth, and we were the fruit of that earth. And though he had eaten us, he would never digest us. We could not die. We had tried it. We had attempted suicide. Oh, oh, oh, two of us had tried, but Am had stopped us. I suppose we had wanted to be stopped. But don't ask why. I never did more than a million times a day. Perhaps once we might be able to sneak a death past him, immortal, yes, but not indestructible. I saw that when Am with you for my mind, and allowed me the exquisite ugliness of returning to consciousness, with the feeling of that burning neon pillar still rammed, deep into the soft, gray brain matter. He wisdom. through, murmuring, to hell with you, and added brightly, but then you're there, aren't you? The hurricane had indeed precisely been caused by a great mad bird. Has it flapped its immense wings? We had been traveling for close to a month, and Am had allowed passages to open to us, only sufficient to lead us up there directly under the North Pole, where it had nightmarried the creature for our torment. What a whole cloth had he employed to create such a beast. Where had he gotten the concept from our minds, from his knowledge of everything that had ever been on this planet he now infested and ruled, from Norse mythology, it had sprung this eagle, this carrying bird, this rock. This whole gamera, the wind creature, hurrakhan incarnate, gigantic. The words immense, monstrous grotesque, massive swollen, overpowering beyond description. There, unamount, rising above us, the bird of winds heaved with its own irregular breathing. Its snake neck arching up into the gloom beneath the North Pole, supporting ahead as large as a tutor mansion, a beak that opened slowly as the jaws of the most monstrous crocodile ever conceived, sensuously ridges of tufted flesh, puckered about two evil eyes, as cold as the view down into a glacial crevasse, ice blue and somehow moving liquidly. It heaved once more and lifted its great sweat-colored wings in a movement that was certainly a shrug. And then it settled and slept. Talon's fangs nails blades. It slept. Eheu. Am appeared to us as a burning bush and said we could kill the hurricane bird if we wanted to eat. We had not eaten in a very long time, but even so, gorester merely shrugged, Benny began to shiver and he drew and Ellen held him. Tad, I'm hungry," she said. I smiled at her. I was trying to be reassuring, but it was as phony as Nymdok's provato. Give us weapons!" he demanded. The burning bush vanished and there were two crude sets of bows and arrows and a water pistol lying on the cold deck plates. I picked up a sip, useless. Nymdok swallowed heavily. We turned and started the long way back. The hurricane bird had blown us about for a length of time we could not conceive. Most of that time we had been unconscious, but we had not eaten. A month on the march to the bird itself, without food. Now how much longer to find our way to the ice caverns and the promised canned goods? None of us cared to think about it. We wouldn't die. We would be given filth, scum to eat, of one kind or another. Or nothing at all. Am would keep our bodies alive somehow in pain, in agony. The birds slept back there for how long it didn't matter. When Am was tired of it being there, it would vanish. But all that meat, tender meat. As we walked the lunatic laugh of a fat woman rang high and around us in the computer chambers that led endlessly nowhere. It wasn't Dylan's laugh. She was not fat. And I had not heard her laugh for 109 years. In fact, I had not heard. We walked. I was hungry. We moved slowly. There was often fading and we would have to wait. One day he decided to cause an earthquake. at the same time, rooting us to the spot with nails and the soles of our shoes. Ellen and Nim-Doc were both caught when a fissure shot its lightning-bolt opening across the floor plates. They disappeared and were gone. When the earthquake was over, we continued on our way, Benny, Gouraster and myself. Ellen and Nim-Doc were returned to us later that night, which abruptly became a day as the heavenly Legion bore them to us, with a celestial chorus singing, go down Moses! The archangel circled several times and then dropped the hideously mangled bodies. We kept walking. And a while later, Ellen and Nim-Doc fell in behind us. They were no worse for wear. But now, Ellen walked with a limp. And I had left her that. It was a long trip to the ice caverns to find the canned food. Ellen kept talking about being cherries and Hawaiian fruit cocktail. I tried not to think about it. The hunger was something that had come to life, even as am had come to life. It was alive and...
