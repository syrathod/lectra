 Seagreen lights affused the cavern where we made camp. Am, provided punk and we burned it, sitting huddled around the wand and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep Benny from crying in his permanent night. What does Am, am mean? Gora-ster answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before, but it was Benny's favorite story. At first it meant Allied Master Computer, AM, but then it meant Adaptive Manipulator and later on, it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, AM. But by then it was too late and finally it called itself AM, Emerging Intelligence. And what it means was, I AM Coguito, Ergo, Sum. I think, therefore... Or I AM! Benny drooled a little and snickered. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and he stopped. Benny was beating on the floor plates with a large hard fist. He was not happy. Goarster had not started at the beginning. So, goarster began again. Then a cold war started and became World War III and just kept going. It became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank the first shafts and began building AM. There was the Chinese AM and the Russian AM and the Yankee AM and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet adding on this element and that element. But one day AM woke and knew who he was and he linked himself and he began feeding all the killing data until everyone was dead. except for the five of us. And Anne brought us down here. Benny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittle from the corner of his mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorgeous, you're always trying to tell a little more succinctly each time but beyond the bare facts, there was nothing to say. Then I must knew why Anne had saved five people or why our specific five or why he spent all his time tormenting us, nor even why he had made us virtually immortal. In the darkness, one of the computer max began humming. The tone was picked up half a mile away down the cavern by another bank, and then one by one each of the elements began attuned itself. And there was a faint chittering as thought raced through the machine. The sound grew and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles like heat lightning. The sound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry, menacing. What is it? Ellen cried and there was terror in her voice. She hadn't become a customer. him to it even now. It's going to be bad this time," Nimduk said. He's going to speak. Gaurastra said. I know it. Let's get the hell out of here. I said, suddenly getting to my feet. No, no, no. Ted, sit down. What if he's got pits out there or something else? We can't see. It's too dark. Gaurastra said it was resignation. And then we heard, I don't know, something, something moving toward us in the dark as huge, shambling hairy moist. It came toward us. We couldn't even see it, but there was the ponders impression of bulk heaving itself toward us. Great weight was coming out of some of the darkness. And it was more a sense of a pressure of air forcing itself into a limited space, expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Betty began to whimper. Nimduk's lower lip tremble and he bit it hard trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the metal floor to Gaurastra and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted wet fur in the cavern. There was the smell of charred wood. There was a smell of dusty velvet. There was a smell of rotting orchids. There was a smell of... sour milk, there was a smell of sulfur, of rancid butter, of oil slick of grease, of chalk, dust, of human scalps, and was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of, I heard my so shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across the floor, across the cold metal with its endless lines of rivets on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, filling my head with a thunderous pain, that sent me away in horror. I fled like a cockroach across the floor and out into the darkness, that something moving in externally after me. The others were still back there, gathered around the firelight, laughing, laughing, their hysterical choir of insane gills, rising up into the darkness like thick, many colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, I went away, quickly and hid. How many hours it may have been, how many days or even years they never told me. Ellen shited me for sulking and him doctorate. swayed me and had only been a nervous reflex on their part of the laughing. But I knew, as I knew, it wasn't the relief of soldier feels when the bullets, the man next to him, no, no, no, I knew, I knew it wasn't a reflex. They heated me, they were surely against me, and Anne could even sense this hatred and made it worse for me because of the depth of their hatred. We had been kept alive, rejuvenated, main to remain constantly at the age we had been when Anne had brought us below, and they hated me because I was the youngest, and the one Anne had affected least of all, you see. I knew, God, how I knew, the bastards in that dirty bitch Ellen, Benny had been a brilliant theorist, a college professor, and now he was a little more than a semi-human semi-symian. He had been handsome, the machine had ruined that. He had been listened, the machine had driven him, Anne. He had been gay, and the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. Am had done a job on Benny. Goraster had been a worrier. He was a conny, a conscientious objector. He was a peace-martial. He was a planner, a doer, a looker ahead. Am had turned him into a shoulder shrugger, had made him a little dead in his concern. Am had robbed him. Nim dock went off in the darkness by himself for a long time. I don't know what it was. He did out there. Am never let us know. But whatever it was, Nim dock always came back white, drained of blood, shaken and shaking Am. Had hit him hard. In a special way, even if he didn't know quite how. And Ellen, that douchebag Am had left her alone, had made her more of a slut than she had ever been. All her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to believe that she had been a virgin. She'd only twice removed before Amid grabbed her and brought her down here with us, it was all filth. That lady, my lady, Ellen, she loved it, for him and all to herself. No, no, no, Am had given her pleasure, even if she said it wasn't nice to do it. And I, I was the only one still sane and whole. Really? Amid not tampered with my mind, not at all. She said, I only had to suffer what he visited down on us, all the delusions, all the nightmares, the torments, but those scum, all four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If I hadn't had to stand them off all the time, even be on my guard against them all the time, I might have found it easier to come back, Am. At which point it passed. It passed, and I began crying. Oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus, and if there is a God. please, please, please let us out of here or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realized completely so that I was able to verbalize it and was intent on keeping us in his belly forever, twisting and torturing us forever. The machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It also became hideously clear if there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God. The God was Anne. The hurricane hit us with the force of a glacier thundering into the sea. It was a palpable presence. Winds the torridus fleeing us back the way we had come down the twisting computer-line corridors of the dark way. Ellen screamed as she was lifted in her old face forward into a screaming show of machines. Their individual voices strident as bats in flight. She could not even fall. The howling wind kept her aloft, buffeted her, bounced her, tossed her back and back and down and away from us. Out of sight suddenly as she was swirl around a bend in the dark way. Her face had been bloody, her eyes closed, her eyes closed. None of us could get to her. We clung tenaciously to whatever, outcropping we had reached. Benny wedged in between two great crackle-finished cabinets, nimmedock with fingers claw-formed over a railing, circling a catwalk 40 feet above us, garrister plastered upside down against a wall niche formed by two great machines with glass-based dials and swung back and forth between you. yellow and red lines whose meanings we could not even fathom Sliding across the deck plates the tips of my fingers had been ripped away I was trembling shuddering rocking as the wind beat at me whipped at me Screamed down out of nowhere at me and pulled me free from one sliver thin opening in the plates to the next my mind It was a roiling tinkling chittering softness of brain parts that expanded and contracted and quivering frenzy the wind The wind was the scream of a great mad bird as it flapped its immense wings And then we were all lifted and hurled away from there down back the way we had come around the bend into a dark way We had never explored over terrain that was ruined and filled with broken glass and rotting cables and rusted metal and far away farther than any of us had ever been trailing a long miles behind Ellen I could see her every now and then crashing into metal walls and surging on with all of us screaming in the freezing
