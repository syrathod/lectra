 have been increasing with the boldest of the light, the rising volume of the sound, because Benny began to mule like a wounded animal. And for softly, softly when the light was dim, and the sound was muted, and then louder, as his shoulders hunched together, his back humped as though he were trying to get away from it. His hands folded across his chest like a chipmunks, his head tilted to the side, this sad little monkey face pinched in anguish, and then he began to howl, howl, as the sound coming from his eyes grew louder, louder, and louder, I slapped the sides of my head with my hands, but I couldn't shut it out, it cut through. Oh, easily the pain shivered through my flesh like tin foil on a tooth, and Benny was suddenly pulled erect on the girder he stood up jerked to his feet like a puppet. The light was now pulsing out of his eyes, to great round beams, the sound crawled up and up some incomprehensible scale. And then he fell forward straight down and hit the plate steel floor with a crash. And he lay there jerking, jerking spastically as the light flowed around him and around him. And the sound spiraled up out of normal range. And then the light beat its way back. Back inside his head, the sound spiraled down. And he was left lying there crying pitiously. His eyes were too soft, moist pools of pus like jelly. And, and had blinded him, gorester and nimmedock. And myself, we, we turned away. But not before we caught the look of relief on Ellen's warm, concerned face. Seagreen lights affused the cavern where we made camp. Am, provided punk and we burned it, sitting huddled around the wand and pathetic fire, telling stories to keep Benny from crying in his permanent night. What does Am, am mean? Gora-ster answered him. We had done this sequence a thousand times before, but it was Benny's favorite story. At first it meant Allied Master Computer, AM, but then it meant Adaptive Manipulator and later on, it developed sentience and linked itself up and they called it an Aggressive Menace, AM. But by then it was too late and finally it called itself AM, Emerging Intelligence. And what it means was, I AM Coguito, Ergo, Sum. I think, therefore... I AM Benny jeweled a little and snickered. There was the Chinese am and the Russian am and the Yankee am and he stopped. Benny was beating on the floor plates with a large hard fist. He was not happy. Gourster had not started at the beginning. So Gourster began again. The Cold War started and became World War III and just kept going. It became a big war, a very complex war, so they needed the computers to handle it. They sank the first shafts and began building am. There was the Chinese am and the Russian am and the Yankee am and everything was fine until they had honeycombed the entire planet adding on this element and that element. But one day am woke and knew who he was and he linked himself and he began feeding all the killing data until everyone was dead. except for the five of us. And Anne brought us down here. Benny was smiling sadly. He was also drooling again. Ellen wiped the spittle from the corner of his mouth with the hem of her skirt. Gorgeous, you're always trying to tell a little more succinctly each time, but beyond the bare facts, there was nothing to say. Then it was new why Anne had saved five people, or why our specific five, or why he spent all his time tormenting us, nor even why he had made us virtually immortal. In the darkness, one of the computer max began humming. The tone was picked up half a mile away down the cavern by another bank, and then one by one each of the elements began attuned itself, and there was a faint shittering as thought raced through the machine. The sound grew, and the lights ran across the faces of the consoles, like heat lightning. The sound spiraled up till it sounded like a million metallic insects, angry, menacing. What is it? Ellen cried, and there was terror in her voice. She hadn't become a customer. to it even now. It's going to be bad this time," Nim Doc said. He's going to speak. Gaurastra said. I know it. Let's get the hell out of here. I said suddenly getting to my feet. No, no, no. Ted said out. What if he's got pits out there or something else? We can't see. It's too dark. Gaurastra said it was resignation. And then we heard, I don't know, something, something moving toward us in the dark as huge, shambling, hairy, moist. It came toward us. We couldn't even see it, but there was the pondress impression of bulk heaving itself toward us. Great weight was coming at us out of the darkness. And it was more a sense of a pressure, of air forcing itself into a limited space, expanding the invisible walls of a sphere. Betty began to whimper. Nim Doc's lower lip tremble and he bit it hard trying to stop it. Ellen slid across the metal floor to Gaurastra and huddled into him. There was the smell of matted wet fur in the cavern. There was the smell of charred wood. There was a smell of dusty velvet. There was a smell of rotting orchids. There was a smell of salt. milk. There was a smell of sulfur, a rancid butter, of oil, slick of grease, of chalk, dust, of human scalps, and was keying us. He was tickling us. There was the smell of, I heard myself shriek, and the hinges of my jaws ached. I scuttled across the floor, across the cold metal with its endless lines of rivets on my hands and knees, the smell gagging me, filling my head with a thunderous pain that sent me away in horror. I fled like a cockroach across the floor and out into the darkness. That something moving in extraordinary after me. The others were still back there, gathered around the firelight laughing, laughing, their hysterical choir of insane gills, rising up into the darkness like thick, many colored wood smoke. I went away, quickly, I went away, quickly, I went away, quickly, and hid. How many hours it may have been? How many days or even years they never told me. Ellen shouted me for soaking, and them doctorate was... me and it had only been a nervous reflex on their part of the laughing. But I knew, see, I knew it wasn't the relief of soldier feels when the bullet hits the man next to him. No, no, no, no, I knew. I knew it wasn't a reflex. They hated me. They were surely against me and Anne could even sense this hatred and made it worse for me because of the depth of their hatred. We had been kept alive, rejuvenated, main to remain constantly at the age we had been. When Anne had brought us below and they hated me because I was the youngest and the one Anne had affected least of all, you see. See, I knew God how I knew the bastards in that dirty bitch Ellen, Benny had been a brilliant theorist to college professor and now he was a little more than a semi-human semi-symian. He had been handsome. The machine had ruined that. He had been listened to the machine had driven him at. He had been gay, and the machine had given him an organ fit for a horse. Am had done a job on Benny. Goraster had been a worrier. He was a conny, a conscientious objector. He was a peace-martial. He was a planner, a doer, a looker ahead. Am had turned him into a shoulder shrugger. Had made him a little dead in his concern. Am had robbed him. Nim dock went off in the darkness by himself for a long time. I don't know what it was he did out there. Am never let us know. But whatever it was, Nim dock always came back white. Drained of blood, shaken and shaking, Am. Had hit him hard in a special way, even if we didn't know quite how. And Ellen, that douchebag Am had left her alone, had made her more of a slut than she had ever been. All her talk of sweetness and light, all her memories of true love, all the lies she wanted us to believe that she had been a virgin. only twice removed before Amid grabbed her and brought her down here with us, was all filth. That lady, my lady, Ellen, she loved it, for him and all to herself. No, no, no, Am had given her a pleasure, even if she said it wasn't nice to do it. And I, I was the only one still sane and whole. Really? Amid not tampered with my mind, not at all. She said, I only had to suffer what he visited down on us, all the delusions, all the nightmares, the torments, but those scum, all four of them, they were lined and arrayed against me. If I hadn't had to stand them off all the time, even beyond my guard against them all the time, I might have found it easier to come back, Am. At which point it passed. It passed and I began crying. Oh, Jesus, sweet Jesus, if there ever was a Jesus and if there is a God. Please, please, please let us out of here or kill us. Because at that moment I think I realized completely so that I was able to verbalize it and was intent on keeping us in his belly forever, twisting and torturing us forever. The machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before. And we were helpless. It also became hideously clear if there was a sweet Jesus and if there was a God. The God was am. The machine hated us as no sentient creature had ever hated before.
