## Lecture Summary: Live Streaming & ML Integration

This lecture covered two main aspects: live streaming architecture and the integration of an ML model for transcription.

**Live Streaming:**

* **Encoding & Transmission:** The stream is encoded on a dedicated server and sent to the backend via RTMB protocol. 
* **Bitrate Management:** The encoded video is stored and segmented based on different bitrates (1, n, d, 7, 20). 
* **Manifest Files:**  These files contain information about video segments and their location, enabling clients to access specific parts of the stream.
* **HLS Protocol:** HTTP Live Streaming protocol is used to deliver the segmented video to clients, providing flexibility in bandwidth usage.

**Cyber Depth Check & Bitrate Settings:**

* A 5-second cyber depth check is employed for smooth streaming.
* The bitrate is set at 1.2 Mbps with 25 frames per second, balancing computational load and bandwidth requirements.

 **ML Integration:**

* **WebSocket Chat:** Integrated a chat functionality using WebSocket for real-time communication.

* **Model Architecture:**
    *  Built the ML architecture using Lion's Head for basic building blocks and Multiflow for multi-earned design. 
    *  The system utilizes a graph structure, with each node representing a distinct task.
* **Transcription Model:**
    * OpenAI's Whisper model is used for automatic speech recognition (ASR).
    * Compared to Google, Microsoft, and other competitors, Whisper demonstrated strong performance based on available data.
